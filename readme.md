# git-fresh

Quickly reset your Git working directory to a clean state without re-cloning. Stashes, wipes, restores, and pops.

## Why git-fresh?

Many developers have the habit of deleting their entire project and running `git clone` again when they encounter issues with their working directory. This is unnecessary and time-consuming! Instead, `git-fresh` performs the following operations:

1. **Stash** your current changes (if any)
2. **Remove** all files except the `.git` directory
3. **Restore** all files from Git
4. **Pop** the stashed changes back

This achieves the same result as re-cloning but much faster and without losing your Git history or remotes.

## Installation

You can run `git-fresh` directly using npx without installing it globally:

```bash
npx git-fresh
```

Or with other package managers:

```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx git-fresh

# Using yarn
yarn dlx git-fresh

# Using bun
bunx git-fresh
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g git-fresh
# or with bun
bun add -g git-fresh
# or with pnpm
pnpm add -g git-fresh
# or with yarn
yarn global add git-fresh
```

## Usage

Simply run the command in any Git repository:

```bash
npx git-fresh
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
git-fresh
```

### Command Line Options

You can use various options to customize the behavior of `git-fresh`:

#### `--ignore-env-files`

Protects environment files from being removed during the reset process. This includes files matching patterns like `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`, and `.*.env`.

```bash
npx git-fresh --ignore-env-files
```

When this option is used, you'll be prompted to choose which environment files to protect, unless you also use `--skip-confirmation`.

#### `--skip-confirmation`

When used with `--ignore-env-files`, this option skips the interactive confirmation and automatically protects all detected environment files.

```bash
npx git-fresh --ignore-env-files --skip-confirmation
```

#### `--ignore-glob-files <pattern>`

Protects files matching the specified glob pattern from being removed during the reset process. This is useful for protecting specific files or file types that you want to keep.

```bash
# Protect all .config files
npx git-fresh --ignore-glob-files "*.config"

# Protect all files in a specific directory
npx git-fresh --ignore-glob-files "temp/**"

# Protect files with specific extensions
npx git-fresh --ignore-glob-files "**/*.{log,tmp}"
```

#### Combining Options

You can combine multiple options as needed:

```bash
# Protect both env files and custom glob pattern
npx git-fresh --ignore-env-files --ignore-glob-files "*.local" --skip-confirmation
```

### What happens when you run git-fresh?

The tool will output progress information as it performs each step:

```text
ðŸš€ Git Fresh - Resetting working directory

âœ“ Changes stashed successfully
âœ“ Files removed successfully  
âœ“ Files restored successfully
âœ“ Stashed changes applied successfully

ðŸŽ‰ Git working directory reset successfully!
```

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clean repository (no uncommitted changes)

```bash
$ npx git-fresh
ðŸš€ Git Fresh - Resetting working directory

â„¹ No changes to stash
âœ“ Files removed successfully
âœ“ Files restored successfully

ðŸŽ‰ Git working directory reset successfully!
```

### Scenario 2: Repository with uncommitted changes

```bash
$ npx git-fresh
ðŸš€ Git Fresh - Resetting working directory

âœ“ Changes stashed successfully
âœ“ Files removed successfully
âœ“ Files restored successfully
âœ“ Stashed changes applied successfully

ðŸŽ‰ Git working directory reset successfully!
```

### Scenario 3: Repository with conflicts during stash pop

```bash
$ npx git-fresh
ðŸš€ Git Fresh - Resetting working directory

âœ“ Changes stashed successfully
âœ“ Files removed successfully
âœ“ Files restored successfully
âš  Could not apply stashed changes (conflicts may exist)
Run "git stash list" to see your stashed changes

ðŸŽ‰ Git working directory reset successfully!
```

### Before and After

**Before running git-fresh:**

- Modified files: `README.md`, `src/index.js`
- Untracked files: `temp.txt`, `debug.log`
- Deleted files: `old-file.js` (was in git)
- Working directory is "dirty"

**After running git-fresh:**

- All files are restored to their committed state
- All untracked files are preserved (via stash)
- All modified files are preserved (via stash)
- Working directory is "clean" but changes are recoverable
- Git history and remotes are unchanged

## What it does

1. **Checks** if you're in a Git repository
2. **Stashes** any uncommitted changes (including untracked files)
3. **Removes** all files and directories except `.git`
4. **Restores** all files from the Git repository
5. **Applies** the stashed changes back (if any were stashed)

## Requirements

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- Git repository

## Safety

- Your Git history remains intact
- Uncommitted changes are safely stashed and restored
- The `.git` directory is never touched
- If conflicts occur during stash pop, your changes remain in the stash

## Development

This project uses Bun for package management:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build

# Validate the package is ready
bun run validate
```

### Testing Locally

To test the package locally before publishing:

1. Build the project: `bun run build`
2. Create a test Git repository in a temporary directory
3. Run the CLI directly: `/path/to/git-fresh/dist/cli.js`

### Publishing

To publish the package to npm:

```bash
# Build and validate
bun run validate

# Publish (requires npm account and authentication)
npm publish
```
